# HR-Wireframe

What remains to be completed:

Positioning the box "section" to the left
Positioning the box "aside" to the right
Layering the boxes within each other, boxes - 'article', html elements '(h1,h2,h3)' and 'p'
Positioning ALL boxes/sections within the center of the page (margins being enough for distances around the page to visually more clean)

Changing each html 'text' to match colors, including styled fonts such as bold lettering
